## What I Learned Using AI Agents
Working with AI agents like ChatGPT and Claude taught me how powerful they can be as coding partners rather than replacements.  
Here’s what stood out to me:
- I learned how to break a large project into smaller, well-defined prompts for better results.  
- The agents helped me understand backend–frontend connections faster, especially when I got stuck with API routes or React errors.  
- I realized that clarity in prompting matters a lot — vague prompts gave vague results, while detailed ones felt like I was working with an actual teammate.

Using AI felt like having a mentor on standby. It didn’t just give me code, it explained *why* something worked (or didn’t), which helped me grasp new concepts more deeply.

## Efficiency Gains Compared to Manual Coding
If I had done everything manually, it would’ve easily taken double the time.  
Some clear efficiency improvements:
- **Faster debugging:** I could paste an error and get quick, targeted fixes instead of searching Stack Overflow for hours.  
- **UI refinement:** AI gave creative CSS and layout suggestions I wouldn’t have thought of alone.  
- **Documentation:** Writing the README, workflow logs, and structured markdown files was way faster with AI guidance.  

Overall, the agents made development smoother and less stressful — I could focus on logic while letting them handle repetitive or boilerplate tasks.

## Improvements for Next Time
Even though AI helped a lot, I noticed some areas where I can do better next time:
- **Validate outputs more carefully.** Sometimes, the code looked correct but failed during runtime.  
- **Balance dependence and creativity.** Instead of fully trusting AI snippets, I plan to use them as references and rewrite them in my own style.  
- **Experiment with multiple agents.** Each one (like ChatGPT, Claude, or Copilot) has different strengths — next time I’d combine them strategically.  
- **Keep better version control.** I sometimes lost track of which snippet came from which agent, so maintaining a structured workflow will help.

Overall, this experience showed me that AI agents aren’t shortcuts — they’re powerful learning tools.  
They don’t replace thinking; they *accelerate* it.
